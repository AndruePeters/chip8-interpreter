# chip8-interpreter
Interpreter for Chip 8. First emulator using this resource: http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/

# Architecture
## Memory
    * 4096 (0x1000) 8-bit memory locations
    * Typically CHIP interpreter occupies the top 512 bytes
    * Uppermost 256 bytes (0xF00-0xFFF) are reserved for display refresh
    * (0xEA0-0xEFF) reserved for call stack.

## Regsiters
    * 16 8-bit registers named V0-VF.
    * VF is the carry flag in addition, no borrow flag in subtraction, draw instruction for pixel collision.
    * Address register, I, is 16-bits wide

## Stack
    * Only used to store return addresses when subroutines are called.
    * Original 1802 had 48 bytes for up to 24 levels of nesting

## Timers
    * Two timers that count down at 60 Hz
        * Delay Timer: Intended to be used for timing events of the games. Can be set and read.
        * Sound Timer: Used for sound effects. When value is nonzero, a beeping sound is made.

## Input
    * Hex Keyboard with 16 keys ranging from 0 to F.
    * '8', '4', '6', and '2' are typically used for directional input

## Audio and Graphics
    * Resolution: 64 * 32 monochrome
    * Sprites are 8 pixels wide and 1-15 pixels heigh
    * Sprite pixels are XOR'd with corresponding screen pixels.
    * VF is set if any screen pixels are flipped from set to unset when a sprite is drawn for collision detection.
    * Beeping sound is played when value of soudn timer is nonzero.

## Opcode Table
    * 35 two-byte opcodes stored in big-endian
    * NNN: address
    * NN: 8-bit constant
    * N: 4-bit constant
    * X and Y: 4-bit register identifier
    * PC: program counter
    * I: 16-bit register (for memory address)
    * VN: One of 16 available variables. N may be 0 to F.
